Come to class and open the computer

Login to the computer and open the terminal

Clone the Repository by typing or copying this command: 
git clone --config="http.proxy=http://youngil2473:PASSWORD@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/youngil2473-cmis/youngil2473-cmis-wd.git

Move to the Repository by typing out this command:
cd youngil2473-cmis-wd

If the Repository cannot be found, use the "ls" command to look for a new folder. That is the Repository

When inside the Repository, use this command:
gedit file.txt
This will creat and open a text file

When done editing the file, use this command:
gitadd file.txt or gitadd .
This will make the git keep track of the changes made to the file

After doing more work than you want to lose, use this command:
git commit -m "REPLACE WITH DESCRIPTION"
This will create a milestone that can be reversed when something goes wrong

When the end of class comes or when you want to be safe, use this command:
git push
This will upload the file.txt back to github

Check with github to make sure the data is saved

When the bell rings, jump up in joy and run
